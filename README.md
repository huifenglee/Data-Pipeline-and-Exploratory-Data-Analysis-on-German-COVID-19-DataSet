# Python-Data-Pipeline-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-German-COVID-19-DataSet
 In this notebook, I build a ETL Pipeline in Python to automatically download and analyze the German Covid-19 Dataset compiled and updated daily by Robert-Koch Institut. Using the downloaded dataset, the notebook performs mainly two tasks: (1) produce the pivot tables for number of cases, death, and recoveries and mortality rates per age group and gender respectively from the beginning of Covid-19 in Germany until the most up-to-date reporting date in the dataset; (2) automatically perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA)  for German Covid-19 infection, death and recoveries by many categories: gender, age groups, landkreis (county), and federal state, and produces many beautiful graphs to illustrate the relationships between covid_19 infection and death rate and GDP per capita, age and gender. The underlying dataset is compiled, prepared and validated by Robert-Koch-Institut.
